(* Taint-tracking via ranges
 * -------------------------
 *
 * First we run a bunch of search queries to obtain the ranges of sources,
 * sanitizers, and sinks. The actual analysis happens in Dataflow_tainting
 * using the IL representation. There we check whether the eorig's and iorig's
 * are within those ranges to decide whether an expression or instruction is a
 * source of taint, a sanitizer, or a sink. Finally we collect the results
 * produced by the dataflow analysis and filter out duplicates.
 *
 * We could think of using an equality test to compare ranges, e.g., an
 * expression would be a source of taint only if its range is exactly one of
 * the ranges matched by `pattern-sources`. In practice, this does not work
 * because `pattern-sources` etc can match anything, and the IL eorig's and
 * iorig's are only expressions. For example, `pattern-sources` can match
 * `foo(x);` but the eorig in the IL will be `foo(x)` whose range does not
 * include the ending `;`.
 *
 * So, we use sub-range checks. And this actually provides some extra power,
 * as it allows us to mark anything as a source/sanitizer/sink. For example,
 * we could use a pattern like `if (E) { ... }` to specify that anything
 * inside such an `if` statement should be considered sanitized. We are not
 * limited to expressions or single statements.
 *
 * However, using sub-range checks leads to duplicates. For example, the PHP
 * expression `sink("$source" . 'here')` will be translated to IL as two
 * instructions `tmp = "$source" . 'here'` and `sink(tmp)`. If `sink(...)`
 * is a `pattern-sinks`, then both instructions' ranges are inside
 * the `pattrn-sinks` ranges. If `$source` is a `pattern-sources`, then both
 * instructions are also tainted, and Dataflow_tainting will report two
 * matches.
 *
 * So, we need to remove duplicate subamtches at the end.
 * TODO: We could perhaps do this in a cleaner way by having an intermediate
 * step where we annotate the Generic AST, marking which statements and
 * expressions are sources, sanitizers, or sinks. If e.g. an expression is a
 * sink, we take care not to mark as sinks any of its subexpressions, in order
 * to prevent duplicates.

    (* NOTE "Symbolic-propagation & Taint-propagation"

       Symbolic-propagation and taint-propagation can interact in a rather
       unfortunate way leading to unexpected results.

       E.g. Give the code below and the propagator `$TO.prepare_url($FROM)`
       we would get a finding in line 4!

           1 def test():
           2      tainted_url = taint
           3      r = safe
           4      sink(r) # unexpected finding :-(
           5      r.prepare_url(tainted_url)

       This is due to symbolic-propagation tracking that `r = safe` and
       `tainted_url = taint`, so the propagator `$TO.prepare_url($FROM)`
       produces **four** matches rather than just one, where `$FROM` is
       either `tainted_url` or `taint`, and `$TO` is either `r` or `safe`.
       So, we end up propagating taint from `taint` (line 2) to `safe`
       (line 3), thus producing a false positive.

       Thus we disable symbolic-propagation to match taint propagators.

       [Iago] I am not sure whether symbolic-propagation should produce
       these four findings, but rather just one. I think we should just
       have `$FROM=tainted_url` and `$TO=r`, and e.g. if we later apply
       a `metavariable-regex` to `$TO` then that needs to take the
       sym-prop'ed value of `r` into account. In fact, that is how it
       works for const-prop'ed values already. But while that gets fixed
       then this is an OK solution.
