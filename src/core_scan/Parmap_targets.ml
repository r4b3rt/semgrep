(* Why do we need init and finalize here? TL;DR; we will segfault randomly when
   tracing is enabled an Parmap is run.

   Parmap works by forking, and then running the function passed to it in the
   child processes, with the xs passed by the parent. Tracing works by calling
   out to c code (curl) that sends data to some telemetry endpoint. This C code
   is called on every GC compaction. For some reason, when we fork, some data is
   not marked as freed, and randomly when we hit a GC cycle the curl code will
   try to free it and segfault.

   So what we must do is, before forking, shut down Tracing to remove the curl
   code that runs on a GC cycle, then after all forking is done we can re-enable
   it in both the parent and child processes. This basically resets the curl
   code and all associated memory so we won't segfault.

   Tracing shuts down and then restarts normally in the parent process once it
   exits as the setup is protected by a Common.protect. In the children though,
   this is not possible due to the architecture of parmap, so we must manually
   setup and teardown tracing via the init and finalize functions, which are
   called by parmap in the child process once before and after f(xs) is
   processed respectively.

   TODO: once we have ocaml 5 with domains we can hopefully rip all this out
   :)

     Sorting the targets by decreasing size is based on the assumption
     that larger targets will take more time to process. Starting with
     the longer jobs allows parmap to feed the workers with shorter and
     shorter jobs, as a way of maximizing CPU usage.
     This is a kind of greedy algorithm, which is in general not optimal
     but hopefully good enough in practice.

     This is needed only when ncores > 1, but to reduce discrepancy between
     the two modes, we always sort the target queue in the same way.

       the ncores processes in small chunks of the specified size
       instead of just dividing the input list into exactly ncores chunks.

       Since our jobs are relatively big compared to the serialization
       and communication overhead, setting the chunk size to 1 works
       fine.  We don't want to have two giant target files in the same
       chunk, so this setting takes care of it.
