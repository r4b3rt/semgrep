(*****************************************************************************)
(* Purpose *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* A "Core" scan.
 *
 * ## pysemgrep vs semgrep-core
 *
 * When invoked by `pysemgrep`, `semgrep-core` will always be passed
 * `-rules` and `-targets`.
 * While the `rules` file is just the collection of rules, the `targets` file
 * describes the mapping of targets to rules.
 * `semgrep-core` follows the target-to-rulemappings without validation
 * or filtering.
 *
 * ## Performance
 *
 * The main components of performance can generally be broken down into:
 *
 * - rule parse time
 * - target parse time
 * - match time
 *   - pattern match time
 *   - formula evaluation time
 *
 * The `-json_time` output includes timings for the three broad components. In
 * general (at least at the time this was written), target parsing takes the
 * longest. Matching does not usually take long, though it can when there are
 * many general patterns (e.g. `$X`) that require going deep
 *(e.g. multiple `...` or `<... $X ...>`). Also, getting the range of a
 * large sub-AST can be slow because it requires collecting all the tokens in
 * that sub-AST. Most of the rules that take longest are generic rules,
 * however, because they run on every file.
 *
 * ## Memory usage
 *
 * Semgrep uses memory liberally. The main components of memory usage can
 * generally be broken down into:
 *
 * - rule parsing
 * - targets file parsing
 *   - in addition to saving the targets, we seem to keep around the
 *     buffer used to parse it
 * - running each target (this should not accumulate)
 *   - parsing the target
 *   - saving the pattern results
 *   - collecting the output for each target
 *   - other memory used while matching
 * - saving the output for each target
 * - some unknown accumulation that happens while running targets but goes
 *   away if we run `Gc.full_major` after each target
 * - creating the final output
 *
 * Of these, the memory used by rule parsing and targets file parsing has an
 * outsized impact on the memory used by multi-process runs because those two
 * structures are used by every process. (They are only read from, but they
 * end up getting copied into the process during garbage collection.) In
 * particular, the targets file is O(num_rules \* num_targets).
 *
 * If we need to reduce memory further, some options include:
 *
 * - Reduce memory used by rule parsing? (Have not investigated but from my
 *   personal profiling this seems too high)
 * - Further streamline the targets file and fix the problem with the buffer
 * - Investigate the unknown accumulation
 * - Compress non-necessary output (namely, `-json_time` is passed by default)
 * - Stream the outputs instead of collecting them and outputting them at the
 *   end
 *
 * For profiling, a useful module is `mem_usage`. See physical memory used in
 * total and by each object with:
 *
 * ```ocaml
 * let phys_mem () = Mem_usage.prettify_bytes (Mem_usage.((info ()).process_physical_memory))
 * let obj_size o = Mem_usage.prettify_bytes (Obj.reachable_words (Obj.repr o) * 8)
 * ```
 *
 * Note that `obj_size` may inadvertently prevent an object from being freed.
 *
 * Additionally, OCaml provides `Spacetime` for certain compilers.
 *It works best on Linux machines.
 *
 * We also have had stack overflows. OCaml <=4.14.0, we avoided this using
 * `List_.map`, which is tail-recursive, instead of `List.map`.

   A target handler returns (matches, was_scanned) where was_scanned indicates
   whether at least one rule applied to the target since the target could
   be excluded by all the rules via per-rule include/exclude patterns.
   alt: baking this flag into match_result type would lead to even worse
   complexity

   Remember that a target handler runs in another process (via Parmap).
