(** Find an offset in a cell.

    This is a somewhat "low-level" version.

    If the offset could not be found in the cell, then it returns `Not_found
    with the base taints and shape for the offset prefix that was found, and
    the offset suffix that was not.

    For example, given this shape:

        Cell(`None, Obj {
                .a -> Cell({"taint"}, Obj {
                        .u -> Cell(`Clean, _|_)
                        })
                })

    with the offset .a we get:

        `Found (Cell({"taint"}, Obj { .u -> Cell(`Clean, _|_) }))

    with the offset .a.u we get:

        `Clean

    and with the offset .a.v we get:

        `Not_found({"taint"}, Obj { .u -> Cell(`Clean, _|_) }, .v)

    For example, if `x` is tainted but `x.a` is not being tracked, it just
    assigns to `x.a` the same taints as `x`. If `x` had polymorphic taint
    (see 'Taint.Var'), then it would attach the offset `.a` to it.
