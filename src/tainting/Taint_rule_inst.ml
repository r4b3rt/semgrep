(* A taint rule inst(ance).
 *
 * This is the "instantiation" of a taint rule for an specific file. A taint rule
 * consists of several pattern formulas that specify what is a source/sink/etc.
 * We instantiate a taint rule by matching those formulas on the file, obtaining
 * a set of "predicates" (see type 'spec_predicates' below) that allow us to label
 * an arbitrary sub-AST in the file as being a source/sink/etc or not. Once we have
 * these predicates, we are then able to run the actual taint analysis.
 *
 * Module 'Match_taint_spec' generates a taint rule instance given a taint rule
 * and a file, and 'Dataflow_tainting' runs the actual taint analysis given a
 * taint rule intance and a function from that file.
