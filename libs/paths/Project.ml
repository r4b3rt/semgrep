(* When the path is not identified as being in a well-defined project,
   we use the following complicated rules:

   - scanning root is a folder: the project root is the folder itself!
   - scanning root is a regular file: the project root is its containing folder

   These rules apply regardless of whether the path is absolute or relative.

   Symbolic links to regular files result in a project root that is
   in general "elsewhere" i.e. not a prefix of the scanning root path:

     scanning root: a.py -> foo/a.py
     project root: /path/to/foo  (not '.')

   To avoid relying on this nonobvious behavior, we recommend that users
   run semgrep on the current folder '.'.

   This function assumes that the path exists.

   A git project created with 'git clone' or 'git init' has a '.git/' folder
   but if worktrees are created, their root only has a '.git' file that
   contains a reference to the main worktree that has the '.git/' folder
   with all the data to manage the local repo and its worktrees.

   For example, my current worktree contains this:

     ~/spro2 $ cat .git
     gitdir: /home/martin/spro/.git/worktrees/spro2
